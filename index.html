                <p>Graduate of Nashville Software School part time web development boot camp.
                    Technology has always been an interest of mine from a very young age. I started learning to code with HTML 
                    when I was 15 and taking an elective web design class in high school.
                    Fast forward to many years later after several major changes in college and a bachelors degree in Social
                    Work, I still felt like something was missing. My friends and family encouraged me to get into a career with 
                    computers. While I was working in the elctronic center of Wal-Mart with celluar devices and technologies,
                    I realized how much I missed working with computers and learning new technology.
                    Software development is my new passion and I am excited to grow and learn so much more as I go!
